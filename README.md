# LAB2
### This is my lab 2 submission.
### Hamda Abuhadid
"""This lab uses the California Housing dataset to compare different regression models:

Simple Linear Regression with ElasticNet

Polynomial Regression with ElasticNet (degree 2)

kNN Regression

I created reusable pipelines, did hyperparameter search with GridSearchCV, and evaluated the models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ². Plots show residuals and predicted vs true values.

All code is in ml_python/lab2/src/housing.py and experiments in the notebook.
